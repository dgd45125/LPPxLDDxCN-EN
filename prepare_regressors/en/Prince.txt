Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest called Real life Stories
It showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal
Here is a copy of the drawing
It said in the book Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing
Then they are not able to move and they sleep for the six months it takes for digestion
So I thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and in turn I managed with a colored pencil to make my first drawing
My Drawing Number one
It looked like this
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups and I asked them if my drawing frightened them
They answered me Why would anyone be frightened by a hat
My drawing was not of a hat
It showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant
I then drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownups could understand
They always need to have things explained
My drawing Number two looked like this
The grownups advised me to leave aside drawings of boa constrictors open or closed and to apply myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar
Thus I abandoned at the age of six a magnificent career as a painter
I was discouraged by the failure of my drawing Number one and of my drawing Number two
Grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to always explain things for them again and again
So i had to choose another profession and I learned to fly airplanes
I flew a little in many places around the world
And geography it is true has served me well
I could recognize at first glance China from Arizona
It is very useful if you get lost at night
I have had during my life a lot of contact with many persons of consequence
I have lived a lot amongst the grownups
I have seen them from close up
It has not much improved my opinion of them
Whenever I met one of them that seemed a bit more clear sighted I tried the experiment of showing them my Drawing number one that I have always kept
I wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding
But they always responded It is a hat
So i would never speak to them of boa constrictors nor of primeval forests nor of the stars
I put myself at their level
I talked to them about bridge golf politics and neckties
And the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man
So I lived alone without anyone I could really talk to until a breakdown in the Sahara desert six years ago
Something had broken in my engine
And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers I readied myself to try and carry out all alone the difficult repairs
For me it was a matter of life or death
I had hardly enough water to drink for a week
The first night i went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation
I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean
So you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak a funny little voice woke me up
It said Please draw me a sheep
What
Draw me a sheep
I jumped to my feet as if I had been struck by lightning
I rubbed my eyes
I took a good look around me
And I saw a quite extraordinary little man who was examining me seriously
Here is the best portrait that later I managed to do of him
But my drawing of course is much less charming than its model
It is not my fault
I was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups at the age of six and I had not learned to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open
I stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment
Remember that I was a thousand miles from any inhabited region
And yet this little fellow seemed neither lost nor half dead with fatigue nor starved or dying of thirst or fear
He looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region
When i finally managed to speak I said What are you doing here
And he repeated very slowly as if it was something very serious Please draw me a sheep
When a mystery is too overpowering one dare not disobey
Absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen
But then I remembered that I had mainly studied geography history arithmetic and grammar and I told the little fellow a little crossly that I did not know how to draw
He replied It does not matter
Draw me a sheep
As I had never drawn a sheep I redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of
The one of the closed boa constrictor
And I was astounded to hear the little fellow respond No No I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor
A boa constrictor is very dangerous and an elephant is very cumbersome
Where i live everything is very small
I need a sheep
Draw me a sheep
So I drew
He looked carefully then said No this one is already very sick
Make another one
I drew again
My friend smiled gently and indulgently
You can see yourself this is not a sheep it is a ram
It has horns
So once again I redid my drawing
But it was rejected like the previous ones
This one is too old
I want a sheep that will live a long time
So getting impatient as i was eager to start dismantling my engine I hastily sketched this drawing
And I snapped
This here is the box
The sheep you want is inside
But I was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up
It is exactly the way I wanted
Do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass
Why
Because where I am from everything is very small
There will certainly be enough
I gave you a very small sheep
He leaned his head towards the drawing
Not that small
Look
He is fallen asleep
And that is how I met the little prince
It took me a long time to find out where he came from
The little prince who asked me many questions never seemed to hear my own
It was the words spoken by chance that little by little revealed everything to me
So when he saw my airplane for the first time I will not draw my airplane it would be a drawing far too complicated for me he asked me
What is that thing there
It is not a thing
It flies
It is an airplane
It is my airplane
And I was proud to have him know that I could fly
Then he cried
What
You fell from the sky
Yes I said modestly
Oh That is funny
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much
I prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously
Then he added
So you also come from the sky
What planet are you from
I caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and I asked abruptly
So you come from another planet then
But he did not answer
He shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane
It is true that you can not have come from far away in that
And he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while
Then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets
So i tried to find out more
Where are you from my little fellow
Where is this where I live of yours
Where do you take my sheep off to
After a reflective silence he answered
What is good about the box you have given is that at night he can use it as a house
That is right
And if you are good I will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day
And a stake
The offer seemed to shock the little prince
Tie him up
What a funny idea
But if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost
My friend broke into another peal of laughter
Where do you think he would go
Anywhere
Straight ahead
Then the little prince said gravely
That does not matter
Where i live everything is so small
And perhaps with a hint of sadness he added
Straight ahead you can not go far
I thus learned a second very important thing that his home planet was barely bigger than a house
It did not surprise me much
I knew that apart from the large planets like the Earth Jupiter Mars and Venus which have been given names there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope
When an astronomer discovers one of these he gives it a number for a name
He might call it for example asteroid three_hundred_twenty-five
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b six_hundred_twelve
This asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in one_thousand_nine_hundred_nine by a Turkish astronomer
He had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference
But nobody had believed him because of his outfit
Grownups are like that
Fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b six_hundred_twelve a Turkish dictator imposed on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the European fashion
The astronomer gave his presentation again in one_thousand_nine_hundred_twenty dressed very stylishly
And this time everybody believed him
If I have told you these details about the asteroid b six_hundred_twelve and revealed to you its number it is because of the grownups
Grownups love numbers
When you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things
They never ask you How does his voice sound
What games does he like best
Does he collect butterflies
They ask How old is he
How many brothers does he have
How much does he weigh
How much money does his father make
Only then do they think they know him
If you said to the grownups I saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their minds
You would have to tell them I saw a hundred thousand franc house
And they would cry How pretty
So if you were to say to them The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming he laughed and he wanted a sheep
If someone wants a sheep that proves they exist they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child
But if you were to say The planet he came from is the Asteroid b six_hundred_twelve they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their questions
They are like that
Do not blame them
Children should be forgiving towards the grownups
But of course those of us who understand life we do not much care for numbers
I would have liked to begin this story in the same way as a fairy tale
I would have liked to say Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet not much bigger than himself and who needed a friend
For those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural
For I do not want my book to be read lightly
I feel so much sadness in recounting these memories
It is already been six years since my friend left with his sheep
If I try to describe him here it is so as not to forget him
It is sad to forget a friend
Not everyone has had a friend
And if I forgot him I could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers
So that is why I have again bought a box of paints and some pencils
It is hard to take up drawing again at my age when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six
I will try of course to make my portraits as lifelike as possible
But I am not quite sure I will succeed
Some drawings go alright
Others do not look like their subjects
I also get the size a bit wrong
Here the little prince is too big
There he is too small
I am also not sure about the color of his outfit
So i fumble along somehow as best I can
I will make mistakes on certain important points too
But you will have to forgive me that
My friend never gave explanations
Perhaps he thought I was just like himself
But I unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through boxes
Perhaps i am a bit like the grownups
I must have got older
Every day I would learn something about his planet the departure and the trip
The information came slowly as his thoughts wandered
It was in this way that on the third day I came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs
This time again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt
It is true is not it that sheep eat shrubs
Yes
It is true
Oh
I am glad
I did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs
But the little prince added Then it follows they also eat baobabs
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab
The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh
They would have to be piled up on top of each other
But he remarked wisely
The baobab trees before they grow up start off small
That is right
But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs
He replied Oh come on
As if it were obvious
And it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help
And indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and bad plants
And therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants
But seeds are invisible
They sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up
Then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig
If it is a sprig of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes
But if it is a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince
There were the seeds of baobab trees
The soil of the planet was infested with them
A baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of
It takes over the entire planet pierces
It with its roots
And if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs they shatter it to pieces
It is a matter of discipline the little prince told me later
After grooming oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groomed
You must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes to which they look very similar when they are very young
It is a very boring job but very easy
And one day he suggested that I apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the children from where I come would understand all this
If one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful
Sometimes there is no harm in postponing one s work
But in the case of baobabs that always leads to a catastrophe
I used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man
He had neglected three little bushes
And based on what the little prince told me I drew this planet
I do not like to sound like a moralist
But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that for once I am breaking my normal reserve
I say Children
Beware of baobabs
It is to warn my friends of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that I have worked so hard on this drawing
The lesson which I pass on by this means was worth the effort
You might be wondering Why is it that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs
The answer is simple I tried but I could not succeed
When I drew the baobabs i was spurred on by a sense of urgency
Oh
Little prince I came to understand gradually in this way your sad life
For a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets
I learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you said to me I am very fond of sunsets
Let us go and see a sunset now
But we have to wait
Wait for what
Wait until the sun goes down
You seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself
And you said I think myself at home still
Indeed
When it is noon in the United States the sun everybody knows is setting over France
It would suffice to be able to go to France in one minute to be able to see a sunset
Unfortunately France is much too far away
But on your tiny planet all you needed was to move your chair a few steps
And you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked
One day I saw the sunset forty four times
And a little later you added You know you love the sunset when you are really sad
The day you saw it forty four times were you were really that sad then
But the little prince made no reply
On the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince s life was revealed to me
He asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem
If a sheep eats shrubs then does it eat flowers too
A sheep eats everything it finds
Even flowers that have thorns
Yes even flowers that have thorns
What are the thorns for then
I did not know the answer
I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck
I was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious and I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear the worst
What are the thorns for then
The little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it
I was upset over the bolt and I said the first thing that came into my head
The thorns are of no use at all
Flowers have thorns just for spite
Oh
But after a moment of silence he exclaimed with a sort of resentment
I do not believe you
Flowers are weak creatures
They are naive
They reassure themselves as best they can
They think themselves frightful with their thorns
I made no reply
At that moment I was thinking to myself
If this bolt will not budge I will knock it out with a hammer
The little prince interrupted my thoughts again
And you actually believe that flowers
No
No
I do not believe it at all
I answered the first thing that came to my mind
I myself am busy with matters of consequence
He looked at me dumbfounded
Matters of consequence
He watched me hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly
You talk just like the grownups
That made me feel a little ashamed
But he went on relentlessly
You confuse everything you mix everything up
He was really very angry
He shook his golden curls in the breeze
I know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman
He has never smelled a flower
He has never looked at a star
He has never loved anyone
He has never done anything but sums
And all day long he repeats just like you
I am busy with matters of consequence
And that makes him swell up with pride
But this is not a man he is a mushroom
A what
A mushroom
The little prince was now white with rage
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years
For millions of years the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same
And it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use
Is the war between the flowers and sheep not important
Is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman
And if i myself know of a unique flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realising what he is done is that not important
He blushed and continued
If someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them
He can say My flower is out there somewhere
But if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out
And you think that is not important
He could not say anything more
He suddenly burst into tears
Night had fallen
I had put down my tools
Of what moment was my hammer my bolt or thirst or death
There was on a star on a planet my planet Earth a little prince to be comforted
I took him in my arms
I rocked him
I said The flower that you love is not in danger
I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep
I will draw you a railing for your flower
I
I
I was not sure what to say
I felt very awkward
I did not know how to reach him where to find him
It is so secretive the land of tears
I learned very quickly to know this flower better
There had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone
They would appear one morning in the grass and by evening they would have faded away
But this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no one knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts
It could have been a new kind of baobab
But the shrub soon stopped growing and began to produce a flower
The little prince who witnessed the appearance of a huge bud felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it but the flower never stopped preparing for her future beauty safe in her green chamber
She chose her colors carefully
She dressed slowly
She arranged her petals one by one
She did not want to come out all rumpled like the poppies
She would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty
Oh yes
She was a very flirtatious creature
And her mysterious adornment had thus lasted for days and days
Then one morning exactly at sunrise she suddenly showed herself
And after having worked with such care and attention to detail she said with a yawn Oh
I have only just woken up
I do apologize
I am not yet presentable
The little prince could not restrain his admiration
You are so beautiful
Am I not the flower responded sweetly
And i was born at the same moment as the sun
The little prince guessed easily enough that she was not very modest but how moving she was
It is time I think for breakfast she added an instant later If you would have the kindness to think of my needs
And the little prince completely abashed having gone to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water tended to the flower
And like that she had soon begun to torment him with her vanity
One day for example speaking of her four thorns she told the little prince
Let them come the tigers with their claws
There are not any tigers on my planet the little prince objected and tigers do not eat weeds
I am not a weed the flower replied sweetly
Please forgive me
I do not fear tigers but i detest drafts
You would not happen to have a screen
Detests drafts
That is bad luck for a plant remarked the little prince
What a very complicated flower
In the evening you will put me under a glass dome
It is very cold where you live
Where I come from
But she interrupted herself
She had come in the form of a seed
She could not have known anything of other worlds
Humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong
The screen
I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me
Then she forced a cough to inflict still more remorse
So the little prince despite the good will of his love had soon come to doubt her
He had taken seriously words of no importance and had become very unhappy
I should not have listened to her he told me one day you should never listen to the flowers
We must look at them and breathe their fragrance
Mine perfumed my whole planet but i did not know how to take pleasure in it
This business of the claws which annoyed me so much should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity
He continued his confidences
I did not know how to understand
I should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words
She overwhelmed me with her fragrance and light
I should never have run away
I should have seen the tenderness behind her contrivances
Flowers are so contradictory
But I was too young to know how to love her
I think that for his escape he took advantage of a migration of a flock of wild birds
On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order
He carefully swept out his active volcanoes
He owned two active volcanoes
It was very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning
He also owned an extinct volcano
But as he used to say You never know
So he cleaned out the extinct volcano too
If they are well cleaned out volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions
Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes
That is why they cause us no end of trouble
The little prince also pulled up with a hint of sadness the last little shoots of the baobabs
He believed he would never return
But all these familiar tasks seemed on that morning very precious
And as he watered the flower one last time and prepared to shelter her under her dome he found himself close to tears
Goodbye he said to the flower
But she did not answer
Goodbye he said again
The flower coughed
But it was not because she had a cold
I was silly she said finally
I ask your forgiveness
Try to be happy
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches
He stood there all bewildered the dome held in mid air
He did not understand this quiet sweetness
Of course I love you the flower said to him
It is my fault that you did not know
That is of no importance
But you have been just as foolish as I have
Try to be happy
Let the dome be
I do not want it anymore
But the wind
My cold is not all that bad
The cool night air will do me good
I am a flower
But the animals
I will have to endure two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies
It seems that they are very beautiful
And otherwise who else will come to visit me
You will be far away
As for the large animals I am not at all afraid of anything
I have my claws
And naively she showed her four thorns
Then she added Do not linger like this it is tiresome
You have decided to leave
Now go
For she did not want him to see her crying
She was such a proud flower
He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids three two five three two six three two seven three two eight three two nine and three three zero
So he began by visiting them to learn more
The first one was inhabited by a king
The king was sitting dressed in purple and ermine on a very simple yet majestic throne
Ah
Here comes a subject exclaimed the king when he caught sight of the little prince
And the little prince asked himself
How could he recognise me when he has never seen me before
He did not know that for Kings the world is very much simplified
To them all men are subjects
Approach so that I may see you better said the king who was very proud to finally be king over somebody
The little prince looked around him for a place to sit but the planet was completely taken over by the magnificent ermine robe
So he remained standing and since he was tired he yawned
It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king the monarch said to him
I forbid you to do so
I can not stop myself replied the little prince thoroughly embarrassed
I have come on a long journey and I have not slept
Ah then the king said
I order you to yawn
I have not seen anyone yawning for years
Yawns to me are objects of curiosity
Come now
Yawn again
It is an order
That frightens me
I can not any more said the little prince blushing
Hum
Hum replied the king
Then I I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to
He sputtered a bit and seemed vexed
For the king fundamentally insisted that his authority be respected
He did not tolerate disobedience
He was an absolute monarch
But because he was good at heart he gave reasonable orders
If I ordered a general he would often say
If I ordered a general to change himself into a seabird and if the general did not obey me it would not be the general s fault
It would be my fault
May I sit down the little prince enquired timidly
I order you to sit down replied the king who majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle
But the little prince was astonished
The planet was tiny
Over what could this king really rule
Sire he said to him excuse my asking you a question
I order you to ask me a question hastened to say the king
Sire over what do you rule
Over everything said the king with a magnificent simplicity
Over everything
The king made a subtle gesture pointing out his planet the other planets and the stars
Over all that asked the little prince
Over all that the king answered
For his rule was not only absolute it was also universal
And the stars obey you
Of course the king said
They obey instantly
I do not tolerate insubordination
Such power filled the little prince with wonder
If he had held it himself he would have been able to watch not forty four but seventy two or even a hundred or even two hundred sunsets on the same day without ever having to move his chair
And as he felt a bit sad as he remembered his forsaken little planet he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour
I would like to see a sunset
Do that for me
Order the sun to set
If i ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly or to write a tragic drama or to change himself into a sea bird and if the general did not carry out the order received which one of us would be in the wrong
You said the little prince firmly
Exactly
One must ask of each person that which they can give the king went on
Authority is based above all on reason
if you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea they would rise up in revolution
I have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable
Then my sunset the little prince reminded him who never forgot a question once he had asked it
You shall have your sunset
I shall command it
But I shall wait according to my science of government until conditions are favourable
When will that be inquired the little prince
Hum
Hum replied the king who consulted a bulky almanac
Hum
Hum
That will be about about that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight
And you will see how well i am obeyed
The little prince yawned
He was regretting his lost sunset
And then he was already getting a little bored
I have nothing more to do here he said to the king
I will set off
Do not go said the king who was very proud of having a subject
Do not go
I will make you a Minister
Minister of what
Minster of of justice
But there is nobody here to judge
We do not know that the king said to him
I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom
I am very old I have no space for a carriage and it tires me to walk
Oh but I have already looked said the little prince who leant over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet
There was no one there either
Then you shall judge yourself the king answered
That is the most difficult thing of all
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly then you are truly wise
Yes said the little prince but i can judge myself anywhere
I do not have to live here
Hum
Hum said the king
I am fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat
I hear him at night
You can judge this old rat
From time to time you will condemn him to death
Thus his life will depend on your justice
But you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him
There is only one of him
I replied the little prince do not like to condemn anyone to death and now I think I will go on my way
No said the king
But the little prince having readied himself to leave had no wish to grieve the old monarch
If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed he should be able to give me a reasonable order
He should be able for example to order me to leave within a minute
It seems to me that conditions are favourable
As the king made no answer the little prince hesitated at first then with a sigh took his leave
I make you my Ambassador the king hastily called out
He had a magnificent air of authority
The grownups are very strange the little prince said to himself as he continued on his journey
The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man
Ah
Here comes a visit from an admirer exclaimed the conceited man from afar the moment he spotted the little prince
Because to conceited men all other men are admirers
Good morning said the little prince
You have a funny hat
It is for saluting the conceited man replied
It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me
Unfortunately nobody ever passes by this way
Oh Really said the little prince who did not understand
Clap your hands one against the other the conceited man advised
The little prince clapped his hands one against the other
The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute
This is more fun than the visit to the king the little prince said to himself
And he began again to clap his hands one against the other
The conceited man again raised his hat in a salute
After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the monotony of the game
And what should I do he asked to make the hat come down
But the conceited man did not hear him
Conceited people never hear anything but praise
Do you really admire me a lot he asked the little prince
What does that mean to admire
To admire means to recognise that I am the most handsome the best dressed the richest and the most intelligent man on the planet
But you are the only man on the planet
Do it for me
Admire me just the same
I admire you said the little prince shrugging his shoulders a little but how can that interest you so much
And the little prince went away
The grownups are certainly very odd he said to himself as he continued his journey
The next planet was inhabited by a heavy drinker
This was a very short visit but it plunged the little prince into a deep sadness
What are you doing there he said to the drinker who he found sitting in silence in front of a number of empty bottles and a number of full bottles
I am drinking replied the drinker gloomily
Why are you drinking the little prince asked him
To forget replied the drinker
To forget what asked the little prince who already felt sorry for him
To forget that I am ashamed confessed the drinker lowering his head
Ashamed of what inquired the little prince who wanted to help him
Ashamed of drinking concluded the drinker who then shut himself away in the silence
And the little prince went away puzzled
The grownups are certainly very very odd he said to himself as he continued on his journey
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman
This man was so busy that he did not even raise his head when the little prince arrived
Good morning the little prince said to him
Your cigarette has gone out
Three and two make five
Five and seven make twelve
Twelve and three make fifteen
Good morning
Fifteen and seven make twenty two
Twenty two and six make twenty eight
No time to light it again
Twenty six and five make thirty one
Phew
Phew
Then that makes five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred and thirty one
Five hundred million what
Huh
Are you still there
Five hundred and one million
I have forgotten now
I have so much work
I am a man of consequence
I do not amuse myself with balderdash
Two and five make seven
Five hundred and one million what repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it
The businessman raised his head
During the fifty four years that I have lived on this planet I have only been disturbed three times
The first time was twenty two years ago by some scatterbrain who fell from god knows where
He made the most dreadful noise and I made four mistakes in a sum
The second time was eleven years ago by an attack of rheumatism
I do not get enough exercise
I do not have time to stroll about
I am a man of consequence
The third time well this is it
I was saying then five hundred and one million
Millions of what
The businessman realised that there was no hope of being left in peace
Millions of those little objects that you see sometimes in the sky
Flies
No no the little things that shine
Bees
No no
The little golden things that make lazy men daydream
As for me I am a man of consequence
I have no time to daydream
Ah
The stars
Yes that is it
The stars
And what do you do with five hundred million stars
Five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred thirty one
I am a man of consequence
I am precise
And what do you do with these stars
What do i do with them
Yes
Nothing
I own them
You own the stars
Yes
But i have already seen a king who
Kings do not own they reign over
It is very different
And how does owning the stars help you
It helps by making me rich
And how does being rich help you
To buy more stars if someone discovers some more
This man the little prince said to himself reasons a bit like my poor drinker
But he still had some questions
How can you own the stars
Who owns them the businessman retorted grumpily
I do not know
Nobody does
Then they belong to me because I thought of it first
Is that all that is necessary
Certainly
When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody it is yours
When you discover an island that belongs to nobody it is yours
When you get an idea first you take out a patent it is yours
And I own the stars because no one before me ever thought of owning them
Yes that is true said the little prince
And what do you do with them
I administer them
I count them and recount them said the businessman
It is difficult
But i am a man of consequence
The little prince was still not satisfied
If I owned a scarf I could put it around my neck and take it away with me
If I owned a flower I could pick my flower and take it away with me
But you can not pick the stars
No
But I can put them in the bank
What does that mean
That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper
And then I lock this paper in a drawer
And that is all
That is enough
That is funny thought the little prince
It is rather poetic
But it is of no great consequence
On matters of consequence the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grownups
I myself he continued own a flower that I water every day
I own three volcanoes that I sweep out every week as I also sweep out the one that is extinct
You never know
It is of some use to my volcanoes and it is of some use to my flower that I own them
But you are of no use to the stars
The businessman opened his mouth but he found nothing to say in response and the little prince went away
The grownups are certainly altogether extraordinary he said to himself as he continued on the journey
The fifth planet was very strange
It was the smallest of them all
There was just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter
The little prince could not work out the purpose of having a street lamp and a lamplighter somewhere out in the skies on a planet without any houses or people
He said to himself nevertheless
It may well be that this man is absurd
But he is less absurd than the king than the conceited man the businessman or the drinker
At least his work has some meaning
When he lights his lamp it is as if he is bringing to life one more star or one more flower
When he puts out his lamp he sends the flower or the star to sleep
That is a beautiful occupation
It serves a real purpose because it is pretty
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter
Good morning
Why have you just put out your lamp
Those are the orders replied the lamplighter
Good morning
What are the orders
That I put out my lamp
Good evening
And he lit it again
But why have you just lit it again
Those are the orders replied the lamplighter
I do not understand said the little prince
There is nothing to understand said the lamplighter
Orders are orders
Good morning
And he put out his lamp
Then he sponged his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares
I have a terrible profession
In the old days it was reasonable
I would put the lamp out in the morning and in the evening I would light it
I had the rest of the day to rest and the rest of the night to sleep
And since then have the orders changed
The orders have not changed said the lamplighter
That is the tragedy
Every year the planet has turned faster and faster and the orders have not changed
So what then said the little prince
So now that it spins round once every minute I no longer have a moment s rest
Once every minute I light the lamp and put it out again
That is funny
Where you live a day only lasts a minute
It is not funny at all said the lamplighter
We have already been speaking for a month
A month
Yes
Thirty minutes
Thirty days
Good evening
And he lit his lamp again
The little prince watched him and felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders
He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in the past by moving his chair
He wanted to help his friend
You know
I know a way you can rest whenever you want
I always want to said the lamplighter
For it is possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time
The little prince went on
Your planet is so small that you can go right round it in three strides
You only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun
When you want to rest you can walk and the day will last as long as you like
That does not do me much good said the lamplighter
What i really love in life is to sleep
That is bad luck said the little prince
That is bad luck said the lamplighter
Good morning
And he put out his lamp
That man said the little prince to himself as he continued further on his journey that man would be despised by all the others by the king by the conceited man by the drinker and by the businessman
Yet he is the only one that does not seem ridiculous to me
Perhaps it is because he thinks of something other than himself
He breathed a sigh of regret and said to himself
That man is the only one with whom I could have made friends
But his planet is really very small
There is no room on it for two people
What the little prince did not dare admit to himself was that he missed this blessed planet most of all because of the one thousand four hundred and forty sunsets every day
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last
It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote enormous books
Oh look
Here comes an explorer he cried out when he caught sight of the little prince
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little
He had already travelled so far
Where do you come from the old gentleman said to him
What is that big book said the little prince
What do you do here
I am a geographer said the old gentleman
What is a geographer
He is a scholar who knows the location of the seas the rivers the towns the mountains and the deserts
That is very interesting said the little prince
That really is at last a real profession
And he glanced around at the planet of the geographer
He had never seen such a majestic planet before
Your planet is very beautiful he said
Are there oceans
I would not know said the geographer
Oh
The little prince was disappointed
And mountains
I would not know said the geographer
And towns and rivers and deserts
I would not know that either said the geographer
But you are a geographer
That is true the geographer said but I am not an explorer
I do not have a single explorer
It is not for the geographer to count the towns the rivers the mountains the seas the oceans and the deserts
The geographer is too important to go strolling about
He does not leave his desk
But he receives the explorers
He asks them questions and he writes down their recollections
And if any of their recollections seem interesting to him the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer s moral character
Why is that
Because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books
So would an explorer who drank too much
Why is that asked the little prince
Because intoxicated men see double
So the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one
I know someone said the little prince who would make a bad explorer
That is possible
So when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order an inquiry is done into his discovery
You go to see it
No
That would be too complicated
But one requires the explorer to provide proof
If for example the discovery in question was of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stones from it
The geographer suddenly became excited
But you you come from far away
You are an explorer
You must describe your planet to me
And the geographer having opened his big register sharpened his pencil
The recitals of explorers are first recorded in pencil
One waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink
Well said the geographer
Oh where I live said the little prince it is not very interesting everything is very small
I have three volcanoes
Two active volcanoes and one extinct one
But you never know
One never knows said the geographer
I also have a flower
We do not record flowers said the geographer
Why is that
It is the prettiest thing
Because flowers are ephemeral
What does that mean ephemeral
Geography books said the geographer of all books are the most concerned with matters of consequence
They never become out dated
It is very rare that a mountain changes position
It is very rare that an ocean empties itself of its water
We write about eternal things
But extinct volcanoes can wake up interrupted the little prince
What does ephemeral mean
Whether volcanoes are extinct or active is of no consequence to us said the geographer
The thing that matters to us is the mountain
It does not change
But what does ephemeral mean repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it
It means which is at risk of imminent disappearance
Is my flower at risk of imminent disappearance
Of course
My flower is ephemeral the little prince said to himself and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world
And I have left her all alone on my planet
That was his first moment of regret
But he took heart once again
What place would you advise me to visit he asked
The planet Earth replied the geographer
It has a good reputation
And the little prince went away thinking of his flower
So the seventh planet was the Earth
The Earth is not just any old planet
It has one hundred and eleven kings not forgetting of course the Negro kings amongst them seven thousand geographers nine hundred thousand businessmen seven million five hundred thousand heavy drinkers three hundred and eleven million conceited men that is to say about two billion grownups
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain over the span of the six continents a veritable army of four hundred and sixty two thousand five hundred and eleven streetlamp lighters
Seen from a distance it made a wonderful spectacle
The movements of this army were regulated like those of an opera ballet
First came the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia
Having set their lamps alight they would go off to bed
Next came the turn of the lamplighters of China and Siberia to enter into the dance
Then they too would disappear into the wings
Then came the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies
Then those of Africa and Europe
Then those of South America
Then those of North America
And never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage
It was magnificent
Only the lamplighter of the single lamp of the North pole and his colleague at the single lamp of the South pole led lives of leisure they worked twice a year
When one wants to be witty it can happen that one bends the truth a little
I have not been entirely honest in telling you about the lamplighters
I run the risk of giving a fasle idea of our planet to those who do not know it
Men take up very little space on the Earth
If the two billion people who inhabit the Earth were to stand upright and squash together a little like for a meeting they would easily fit on one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide
All humanity could be piled up on the smallest Pacific islet
The grownups of course will not believe you
They picture themselves as taking up a lot of space
They think themselves as important as the baobabs
Therefore you should advise them to do the math
They adore numbers and that will please them
But do not waste your time on this chore
There is no point
You trust me
The little prince having arrived on Earth was very surprised not to see anyone
He had already started to worry that he had got the wrong planet when a moon colored coil stirred in the sand
Good evening said the little prince courteously
Good evening said the snake
On what planet have I come down on asked the little prince
Onto Earth in Africa the snake answered
Oh
So there is no one on Earth
This is the desert
There is no one in the deserts
The Earth is large said the snake
The little prince sat down on a stone and raised his eyes toward the sky
I wonder he said if the stars are lit so that each of us can one day find his own again
Look at my planet
It is right there above us
But it is so far away
It is beautiful said the snake
What has brought you here
I have been having some trouble with a flower said the little prince
Ah said the snake
And they were silent
Where are the men asked the little prince at last
It is a bit lonely in the desert
It is also lonely amongst men the snake said
The little prince gazed at him for a long time
You are a funny animal he said finally as thin as a finger
But I am more powerful than the finger of a king said the snake
The little prince smiled
You are not very powerful
you have not even got any legs
you can not even travel
I can carry you further than a ship said the snake
He wrapped himself around the little prince s ankle like a golden bracelet
Whoever I touch I send him back to the earth from which he came he continued
But you are pure and you come from a star
The little prince made no reply
I feel sorry for you so weak on this Earth made of granite
I can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet
I can
I understand very well said the little prince but why do you always speak in riddles
I solve them all said the snake
And they were silent
The little prince crossed the desert and met only with one flower
A flower with three petals a nondescript flower belonging to no one
Good morning said the little prince
Good morning said the flower
Where are the men asked the little prince politely
The flower had once seen a caravan passing
Men
I think there exists six or seven of them
I saw them years ago
But you never know where to find them
They are blown here and there by the wind
They lack roots it makes things very difficult for them
Goodbye said the little prince
Goodbye said the flower
The little prince climbed a high mountain
The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes that came up to his knees
And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool
From a mountain as high as this one he said to himself I will be able to see the entire planet all at once and all the people
But he saw nothing but sharp needles of rock
Good morning he said courteously
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning answered the echo
Who are you said the little prince
Who are you
Who are you
Who are you answered the echo
Be my friends
I am all alone he said
I am all alone
All alone
All alone answered the echo
What a funny planet he thought
It is all dry and all jagged and all barren
And the people have no imagination
They repeat whatever you say to them
On my planet I had a flower
She was always the first to speak
But it happened that the little prince having walked for a long time through the sands rocks and snow at last came across a road
And all roads lead to the dwellings of men
Good morning he said
It was a garden covered in roses
Good morning said the roses
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The little prince gazed at them
They all looked just like his flower
Who are you he asked them stunned
We are roses the roses said
We are roses
We are roses
We are roses
Oh said the little prince
And he suddenly felt very unhappy
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe
And here were five thousand of them all alike in one single garden
She would be very upset he said to himself if she saw this
She would cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid being laughed at
And I would have to pretend to nurse her back to life to humble myself also because if I did not she really would allow herself to die
Then he said to himself I thought I was rich with a flower that was one of a kind and all I have is a common rose
That and my three volcanoes that come up to my knees one which is perhaps forever extinct
That does not make me a very great prince
And lying in the grass he started to cry
It was then that the fox appeared
Good morning said the fox
Good morning responded the little prince politely who then turned around but saw nothing
I am right here the voice said under the apple tree
Who are you asked the little prince
You are very pretty
I am a fox the fox said
Come and play with me proposed the little prince
I am so unhappy
I can not play with you said the fox
I am not tamed
Oh
I am sorry said the little prince
But after some thought he added
What does that mean tame
You are not from here said the fox
What is it that you are looking for
I am looking for men said the little prince
What does tame mean
Men said the fox they have guns and they hunt
It is very bothersome
They also raise chickens
It is their sole interest
Are you looking for chickens
No said the little prince
I am looking for friends
What does tame mean
It is something that is too often forgotten said the fox
It means to establish bonds
To establish bonds
That is right said the fox
To me you are still only a little boy just like a hundred thousand other little boys
And I do not need you
And you do not need me either
To you I am only a fox just like a hundred thousand other foxes
But if you tame me we will need each other
To me you will be unique in the entire world
To you I will be unique in the entire world
I am beginning to understand said the little prince
There is a flower
I think she has tamed me
It is possible said the fox
On Earth you see all kinds of things
Oh but she is not on Earth said the little prince
The fox seemed very intrigued
On another planet
Yes
Are there hunters on that planet
No
That is interesting
And chickens
No
Nothing is perfect sighed the fox
But the fox came back to his idea
My life is very monotonous
I hunt chickens
Men hunt me
All the chickens look alike and all the men look alike
So i get a bit bored
But if you tame me it would bring some sunlight into my life
I would come to know a sound of footsteps unlike any other
Other footsteps send me hurrying back underground
Yours would call me out of my burrow like music
And then look
You see the wheat fields down there
I do not eat bread
Wheat is of no use to me
The wheat fields mean nothing to me
And that is sad
But your hair is the color of gold
So it will be wonderful when you have tamed me
The wheat which is golden will remind me of you
And I will love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat
The fox went silent and gazed at the little prince for a long time
Please tame me he said
I really want to the little prince replied but I do not have much time
I have friends to discover and many things to understand
One only understands the things that one tames said the fox
Men no longer have the time to get to know anything
They buy things ready made in the shops
But as there are not any shops that sell friends men no longer have any friends
If you want a friend tame me
What should I do asked the little prince
You have to be very patient replied the fox
First you will sit down a little way away from me like this in the grass
I will watch you out of the corner of my eye and you will not say anything
Words are a source of misunderstandings
But every day you will be able to sit a little closer
The next day the little prince came back
It would have been better to come back at the same time of day said the fox
If you come for example at four o clock in the afternoon from three o clock I would start to feel happy
As the time got nearer I would feel happier and happier
Already by four o clock I would be jumping about and getting restless
I would come to learn the price of happiness
But if you come at just any time I would never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you
We must observe the rites
What is a rite asked the little prince
They are also something too often forgotten said the fox
They are what make one day different from other days one hour different from other hours
There is a rite for example among my hunters
On Thursdays they dance with the girls of the village
So Thursday is a wonderful day
I can go for a walk as far as the vineyards
If the hunters danced on just any day all the days would be alike and I had never have any rest
So the little prince tamed the fox
And when the time to leave drew near
Oh said the fox I will cry
It is your fault said the little prince
I never wished you any harm
But you wanted me to tame you
I know said the fox
But you are going to cry said the little prince
I know said the fox
So all this has done you no good at all
It has done me good said the fox because of the color of the wheat
And then he added
Go and see the roses again
You will understand that yours is unique in the entire world
Then come back to say goodbye to me and I will make you a present of a secret
The little prince went away to see the roses again
You are not like my rose at all you are nothing yet he told them
No one has tamed you and you have not tamed anyone
You are like my fox used to be
He was only a fox just like a hundred thousand others
But I have made him my friend and now he is unique in the entire world
And the roses were very embarrassed
You are beautiful but you are empty he went on
One could not die for you
Of course an ordinary passer by would think that my rose looked just like you
But she alone is more important than all of you
Because it is her that I watered
Because it is her that I put under the glass dome
Because it is her that I sheltered behind the screen
Because it is for her that I killed the caterpillars except two or three to become butterflies
Because it is her that I listened to grumble or boast or even sometimes when she said nothing
Because she is my rose
And he went back to the fox
Goodbye he said
Goodbye said the fox
Here is my secret
It is very simple
One only sees clearly with the heart
What is essential is invisible to the eye
What is essential is invisible to the eye repeated the little prince so as to remember
It is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important
It is the time that i have wasted on my rose said the little prince so as to remember
The men have forgotten this truth said the fox
But you must not forget it
You become forever responsible for that which you have tamed
You are responsible for your rose
I am responsible for my rose repeated the little prince so as to remember
Good morning said the little prince
Good morning said the railway switchman
What do you do here the little prince asked
I sort travelers in packs of a thousand said the switchman
I dispatch the trains that carry them sometimes to the right sometimes to the left
And a brilliantly lit express train rumbling like thunder shook the switchman s cabin
They really are in a hurry said the little prince
What is it that they are looking for
Not even the locomotive engineer knows that said the switchman
A second brilliantly lit express thundered by in the opposite direction
Are they back already asked the little prince
These are not the same ones said the switchman
It is an exchange
Were not they happy where they were
No one is ever happy where they are said the switchman
A third brilliantly lit express thundered by
Are they chasing after the first travelers asked the little prince
They are not chasing after anything at all said the switchman
They are asleep in there or if not they are yawning
Only the children are squashing their noses up against the windows
Only the children know what they are after said the little prince
They waste their time with a rag doll and it becomes very important to them
And if someone takes it away from them they cry
They are lucky said the switchman
Good morning said the little prince
Good morning said the merchant
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst
You could take one pill a week and you no longer felt the need to drink anything
Why are you selling those asked the little prince
It is a big time saver said the merchant
Experts have done calculations
You save fifty three minutes per week
And what do I do with the fifty three minutes
You can do anything you like with them
Myself the little prince said to himself if I had fifty three minutes to spend as I liked I would walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water
We were at the eighth day since my accident in the desert and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I drank the last drop of my water supply
Ah I said to the little prince these memories of yours are very charming
But I have not managed to repair my plane yet I have nothing left to drink and I too would be happy if I could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water
My friend the fox he said to me
My dear fellow our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore
Why not
Because we will die of thirst
He did not follow my reasoning and he answered me
It is nice to have had a friend even if you are about to die
Myself I am glad to have had a fox as a friend
He never considers the danger I said to myself
He has never been hungry or thirsty
A little sunshine is all he needs
But he looked at me and replied to my thought
I am also thirsty
Let us look for a well
I made a gesture of weariness
It is absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert
But we started walking anyway
When we had walked for hours in silence night fell and the stars began to come out
I saw them as if in a dream as my thirst had made me feverish
The little prince s words danced in my memory
So you are also thirsty I asked him
But he did not reply to my question
He said simply
Water can be good for the heart too
I did not understand his answer but I said nothing
I knew better than to press my questions
He was tired
He sat down
I sat down beside him
And after a silence he spoke again
The stars are beautiful because of a flower that can not be seen
I replied That is true
And I looked without saying anything at the folds of sand in the moonlight
The desert is beautiful the little prince added
And it was true
I have always loved the desert
You sit down on a sand dune
You see nothing
You hear nothing
And yet something radiates forth in the silence
What makes the desert beautiful said the little prince is that somewhere it hides a well
I was surprised to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sands
When I was a little boy I lived in an old house and legend told that a treasure was buried there
Of course no one had ever been able to find it or perhaps no one had even looked for it
But it cast an enchantment over that house
My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart
Yes I said to the little prince
Whether the house the stars or the desert what gives them their beauty is something invisible
I am glad he said that you agree with my fox
As the little prince fell asleep I took him in my arms and set out walking again
I felt deeply moved
It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure
It even seemed to me that there was nothing more fragile on Earth
I looked in the moonlight at his pale forehead his closed eyes his locks of hair that trembled in the wind and I said to myself
What I see here is only a shell
That which is most important is invisible
As his slightly parted lips gave way to a half smile I continued
What I find so deeply moving about this little sleeping prince is his devotion to a flower
It is the image of a rose that shines in him like the flame of a lamp even when he is sleeping
And I came to think of him as even more fragile one has to look after lamps
A gust of wind can put them out
And continuing to walk I found the well at daybreak
Men said the little prince stuff themselves into express trains but they do not know what they are looking for
So they rush about and go in circles
And he added
It is not worth it
The well we had reached was not like the other wells of the Sahara
The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand
This one looked like a village well
But there was no village there and I thought I was dreaming
It is strange I said to the little prince
Everything has been prepared the pulley the bucket and the rope
He laughed took the rope and put the pulley to work
And the pulley moaned like an old weathervane when there has long been no wind
Can you hear that said the little prince
We have woken up the well and it is singing
I did not want him to tire himself out
Let me do it I said
It is too heavy for you
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level
The song of the pulley continued in my ears and in the still trembling water I could see the sunlight shimmer
I am thirsty for this water said the little prince
Give me some to drink
And I knew then what he had been looking for
I raised the bucket to his lips
He drank his eyes closed
It was as sweet as some special festival treat
This water was something very different from ordinary nourishment
It was born of the walk under the stars of the song of the pulley of the effort of my arms
It was good for the heart like a present
When I was a little boy the lights of the Christmas tree the music of the Midnight Mass the tenderness in the smiles produced in a similar way the radiance of the gift that I received
The men where you live said the little prince grow five thousand roses in a single garden
And they do not find what they are looking for in it
They do not find it I replied
And yet what they are looking for could be found in a single rose or in a little water
That is true I said
And the little prince added
But the eyes are blind
You have to search with the heart
I had drunk the water
I breathed easily
The sand at sunrise is the color of honey
This honey color was also making me feel good
Why then did i have to have this sense of grief
You have to keep your promise said the little prince softly who had again sat down beside me
What promise
You know
A muzzle for my sheep
I am responsible for this flower
I took my sketches out of my pocket
The little prince saw them and laughed as he said
Your baobabs they look a bit like cabbages
Oh
And I had been so proud of my baobabs
Your fox his ears they look a bit like horns and they are too long
And then he laughed again
You are not being fair my little fellow
I do not know how to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open
Oh it will be ok he said children understand
So I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle
And I felt a pang in my heart as I gave it to him
You have plans that I do not know about
But he did not respond
He said to me
You know my descent to earth
Tomorrow will be its anniversary
Then after a silence he went on
I came down very near here
And he blushed
And once again without understanding why I felt a peculiar sense of sorrow
One question occurred to me however
So it was not by chance that the morning I first met you a week ago you were out walking like that all alone a thousand miles from any inhabited region
You were going back to the place where you landed
The little prince blushed again
And I added hesitantly
Perhaps because of the anniversary
The little prince blushed once more
He never answered questions but when you blush that means yes does not it
Oh I said to him I am worried
But he responded
Now you must work
You must go back to your engine
I will wait for you here
Come back tomorrow evening
But I was not reassured
I remembered the fox
You run the risk of weeping a little if you allow yourself to be tamed
There was next to the well the ruin of an old stone wall
When I came back from my work the next evening I saw from a distance my little prince sitting on top of it his feet hanging down
And I heard him say
Do not you remember then
This is not the exact spot
Another voice must have answered him because he replied
Yes yes
It is the right day but this is not the right place
I continued my walk toward the wall
I still did not see or hear anyone
Yet the little prince replied again
That is right
You will see where my tracks begin in the sand
You just have to wait there for me
I will be there tonight
I was twenty meters from the wall and I still saw nothing
The little prince spoke again after a pause
Do you have good poison
Are you sure you will not make me suffer too long
I froze my heart skipped a beat
But i still did not understand
Now go away he said
I want to come down from here
I then lowered my eyes to the foot of the wall and I leapt up
Right there facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that can kill you in thirty seconds flat
Even as i dug around in my pocket to take out my revolver I made a running step back
But at the noise I made the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arms who was white as snow
What is going on here
Why are you talking with snakes
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore
I had moistened his temples and had him drink
And now I did not dare ask him anything more
He looked at me gravely and put his arms around my neck
I felt his heart beat like the heart of a dying bird when shot with a rifle
He said to me
I am glad that you have found what was wrong with your engine
Now you will be able to go back home
How did you know
I was just coming to tell him that against all aga my work had been successful
He made no answer to my question but he added
I am also going back home today
Then he said sadly
It is a lot further
It is much more difficult
I felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening
I held him tightly in my arms like a small child
And yet it seemed to me that he was plummeting down into an abyss and that I could do nothing to restrain him
He had a serious look as if lost far away
I have your sheep
And I have the box for the sheep
And I have the muzzle
And he smiled sadly
I waited a long while
I could feel that he was reviving little by little
My little fellow I said to him you are afraid
He was afraid of course
But he laughed softly
I will be much more afraid this evening
Again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable
And I knew that I could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again
For me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert
Little fellow I said I want to hear you laugh again
But he said to me
Tonight it will be a year
My star will be right above the spot where I came down to Earth a year ago
Little fellow is this all a bad dream this business with the snake and the meeting place and the star
But he did not answer my question
He said to me
That which is important can not be seen
I know
It is like with the flower
If you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night
All the stars are covered with flowers
I know
It is like with the water
The water you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley and the rope
You remember
It was good
I know
At night you will look at the stars
Where I live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is
It is better like that
My star will be for you just one of the stars
So you will love to look at all of the stars
They will all be your friends
And besides I am going to make you a present
He laughed again
Ah little fellow dear little fellow
I love to hear that laugh
That is my present
Just that
It will be like with the water
What are you trying to say
Everyone has the same stars but they are not the same to everyone
For some who are travelers the stars are guides
For others they are nothing but little lights
For others who are scholars they are problems
For my businessman they were wealth
But none of these stars say anything back
You will have the stars as no one else has them
What are you trying to say
When you look at the sky at night because I will be living on one of them because I will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the stars are laughing
You only you will have stars that can laugh
And he laughed again
And when your sorrow is comforted time heals all wounds you will be glad to have known me
You will always be my friend
You will want to laugh with me
And sometimes you will open your window just like that for fun
And your friends will be very surprised to see you laughing whilst watching the sky
So you will tell them Yes the stars always make me laugh
And they will think you are crazy
I will have played a dirty trick on you
And he laughed again
It will be as if I would given you instead of stars lots and lots of little bells that can laugh
And he laughed some more
Then he suddenly became serious again
Tonight you know do not come
I will not leave you
It will look as if I am suffering
It will look a bit as if I am dying
It is like that
Do not come to see that
It is not worth it
I will not leave you
But he was worried
I am telling you this it is also because of the snake
He must not bite you
Snakes are mean
They can bite you just for fun
I will not leave you
But something reassured him
It is true that they have no poison left for a second bite
That night I did not see him set out
He got away without making a sound
When I managed to catch him up he was walking along determinedly at a brisk pace
He said to me only
Oh
You came
And he took me by the hand
But he was still worrying
You have made a mistake
You will suffer
It will look as if I am dead and that will not be true
I said nothing
You understand
It is too far
I can not carry this body with me
It is too heavy
I said nothing
But it will be like an old abandoned shell
There is nothing sad about old shells
I said nothing
He got a bit discouraged
But he made one more effort
You know it will be nice
I will also look at the stars
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink
I said nothing
It will be so much fun
You will have five hundred million little bells and I will have five hundred million springs of fresh water
And then he too was silent because he was crying
Here is the place
Let me go on by myself
And he sat down because he was afraid
He said You know my flower
I m responsible for her
And she is so weak
And she is so naive
She has four thorns of no use at all to protect herself against the entire world
I sat down too because I was no longer able to stand
He said That is everything
He hesitated a bit and then stood back up
He took one step
I could not move
There was nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle
He remained motionless for an instant
He did not cry out
He fell as gently as a tree falls
There was not even any sound because of the sand
And now of course it has already been six years
I have never yet told this story
The companions who met me were very happy to see me alive again
I was sad but I told them It is because I m tired
Now my sorrow is comforted a little
I mean not entirely
But I do know that he got back to his planet because at daybreak I did not find his body
It was not a very heavy body
And I love to listen to the stars at night
It is just like five hundred million little bells
But there is one extraordinary thing
When I drew the muzzle for the little prince I forgot to add the leather strap to it
He would never have been able to fasten it to the sheep
So I wonder what happened on his planet
It may well be the sheep ate the flower
Sometimes i tell myself Surely not
The little prince shuts his flower under her glass dome every night and he watches over his sheep very carefully
Then I m happy
And all the stars laugh sweetly
Other times I tell myself Everyone is absent minded at some point and that is all it takes
One evening he would have forgotten the glass dome or maybe the sheep got out quietly during the night
And then the little bells turn to tears
Herein lies a great mystery
For you who also love the little prince just like for me nothing in the universe is the same if somewhere out there a sheep that we have never seen has has it eaten a rose
Look at the sky
Ask yourselves Has the sheep yes or no eaten the flower
And you will see how everything changes
And no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of such importance
This to me is the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world
It is the same landscape as the one on the previous page but I have drawn it again to show it to you properly
It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth and then disappeared
Look at this landscape carefully so as to be sure to recognize it if one day you travel in Africa in the desert
And if you happen to pass by there I beg you do not hurry on wait a while exactly under the star
If a child then comes to you if he laughs if he has golden hair if he does not respond when questioned you will easily guess who it is
So think of me
Save me from this sorrow write to me quickly to tell me he is back
